// This file is auto-generated from source files in `/lib/.proto/*` using Protocol Buffers (protobuf)
//
// Protobuf is a language-neutral, platform-neutral serialization format. It allows users
// to define objects in a way that’s both efficient to store and fast to transmit over the network.
// These definitions are compiled into code that *enables different systems and programming languages
// to communicate in a byte-perfect manner*
//
// To update these structures, make changes to the source .proto files, then recompile
// to regenerate this file.
// These auto-generated files are easily recognized by checking for a `.pb.go` ending

// ValidatorsList is stored as a single blob (instead of using prefixed keys) for the following reasons:
//
// - Filesystem database iterators (e.g., in LevelDB/PebbleDB) introduce significant overhead and are often slow,

//
// - The total number of validators is expected to remain below 100,000, and each entry is relatively small (~200 bytes),
//   making a full in-memory deserialization manageable and performant.
//
// - Validators are expected to participate in most committees, so the majority of the list is relevant to each context,
//   and filtering from a single list is faster than multiple disk reads.
//
// - Storing separate, per-committee lists (especially if sorted and updated every block) would create substantial
//   additional write and storage overhead compared to maintaining a single, compact list.
