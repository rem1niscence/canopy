Indexer Blob

Overview
This package includes helpers for producing an "indexer blob" that bundles the
current and previous block's state data into a single protobuf response. The
blob is intended for indexers that want to hydrate state with one request.

What's inside
- Block bytes (protobuf)
- Raw state bytes for accounts, pools, validators, non-signers, dex batches
- Pre-marshaled structures for dex prices, orders, params, and double signers
- Committee data, subsidized committees, retired committees
- Supply bytes

Usage
- fsm.StateMachine.IndexerBlob(height) returns the protobuf-ready structure
  for a specific height.
- fsm.StateMachine.IndexerBlobs(height) returns current and previous blobs.
